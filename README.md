# Ecstasy

3D game made in Delphi and OpenGL for Windows (95, Xp). EPITA school project. Our first team project, so sorry this is not a optimized game and use it 'as it' !

Notes:

* install/speedway.rar contains the runnable version Windows (95, Xp). You will need to unrar data/data.rar in the same directory than the exec.
