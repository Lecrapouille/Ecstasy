# Ecstasy

3D game made in Delphi and OpenGL for Windows (95, Xp). EPITA school project. Our first team project, so sorry this is not a optimized game and use it 'as it' !

Features are:
* city generated randomly on a torus world.
* cars stopped at traffic lights.
* cars have a physic model.

Not implemented:
* missing a fixed frame rate.
* no collision detection.
* no IA (collision avoidance, cars do not turn).
* off-road partially implemented.
* city generation with a procedural process.
* disable physics when cars are too far from the player.

Notes:

* install/speedway.rar contains the runnable version Windows (95, Xp). You will need to unrar data/data.rar in the same directory than the exec.
